Many times people tweet asking for recommendations on services and products. If you have a big following, you may get a TON of replies, which (1) is very powerful, but (2) is hard to aggregate. This tool begins that aggregation. 

This tweet highlights the need well: https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1339253298696622080

## Motivation
I love Twitter and it's an information funnel for me. I love leveraging Tweetdeck, filters, lists, and more to gain insights. This tool scratches an itch I have.

I plan to build a very very simple frontend that will let users just paste in a tweet URL, click a button, and get the analysis in a nicely formatted way. I will be using this project to further my knowledge of Vue. I use Angular a lot at work, but want to get better at Vue.
